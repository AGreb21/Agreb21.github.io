Hi, my name is Alex Greb I am a junior data science major, student-athlete at Chaminade University. I was born in Chicago, Illinois, and was raised in Seattle Washington since I was 2 years old. I attended Ballard High School, graduating in the class of 2022. I decided to go to Wenatchee Valley Community College after high school, in pursuit of continuing my athletic career in baseball. I most recently just transferred to Chaminade continuing my athletic career on the baseball team as well as pursing a degree in data science.

I have a brother who is currently a senior at Whitman college, in Walla Walla, Washington, and he is also a data science major like me. My mom graduated with a bachelors degree from the university of Maine, and currently owns and runs her own accounting business. My dad graduated from the University of Michigan with a masters degree and currently works in advertising.
